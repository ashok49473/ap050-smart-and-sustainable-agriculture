Avoid mixing alkaline water. The spray volume of solution may vary depending on crop growth stage and spacing To make 2% Urea solution you have to mix 2kg of Urea in 100 liters of water. (20g in 1 liter of water) you should be cautious with application of high urea concentrations with possible leaf injury/burning. Instead of urea foliar fertilizer like Potassium nitrate can be sprayed at 1% (100g in 200 liters of water) which impart resistance also because of high potassium content.",
