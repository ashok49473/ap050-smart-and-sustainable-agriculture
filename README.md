# AP050-Smart and Sustainable Agriculture using FPGA

“Farm at ease” (Technology to farming):
To meet the growing population of the world, some serious reforms are required in the agricultural sector to ensure that our food system is ready to meet the upcoming challenges. This pushes us to shift from traditional/conservative agricultural practices to sustainable practices. Further, these sustainable practices are integrated with technological advancements, the major challenges of the agriculture/farming across the world can be resolved in an efficient and effective manner.
The following are some of the key challenges posed by the agricultural sector:
1. There is a considerable gap between the adoptions of technology in the agricultural sector when compared to the non-agricultural sectors especially in third world countries.
2. Mismanagement in crop planning without the proper analysis of soil.
3. Overutilization/underutilization of fertilizers.
4. Mismanagement in irrigation and thereby the water scarcity/wastage may occur.
5. Delay in identification of weeds/pests.
6. Unable to adopt the best practices of agriculture in the other regions.
Proposed solution:
To address above challenges, we are proposing for a design of a system (IOT based with Mobile/Web application development/Message alert system) which will aid the farmer in the following way:
1. Crop recommendation based on the soil condition, climate and water availability of that region.
2. Automatic irrigation system depending upon the crop requirement.
3. Recommendation of organic means of agriculture practice in place of fertilizers to the most possible extent.
4. Disease detection in crops using image processing.
5. Recommendation/alert system will be made in a simple manner and if possible, voice instructions will be given in regional languages.
Design idea:
The above-proposed idea will be designed initially as a real-time prototype device where FPGA board will be integrated with sensors such as NPK sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, water level monitoring sensor, etc., Further, a communication shall be established between the FPGA board and mobile phone using FPGA virtues, Azure cloud, etc., This prototype device will be tested in a real-time agricultural field and based on the feedback/recommendations of the user (farmers) a robust system may be developed in future.
